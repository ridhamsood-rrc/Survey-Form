# Front End Development Assignment 4

## Reflection

In this assignment, I made a survey form in which the user will be giving
his personal information, so that the government can have an idea of
much students are studying with a valid study permit. So, that they can
build a report for their personal use. The user will have to give his
email address, phone number and have to answer some questions. If the user
have not filled any of the fields, they are not permitted to submit the
form. Once all the fields are filled, the user will click on the submit
button which will take the user to the given link. That's the basic
functioning of the survey form.

### Validations

The fields like username, email address and phone number will be checked
that they are filled or not. If not, the user will get an error stopping
the user to submit the form. The fields like email address and phone number
should be filled with valid input like phone number must contain 10 digits
and email address should contain @ sign. The checkboxes and dropdown menu,
one option should be checked or selected from these menus. If not, an error
will be thrown to the user stopping the user to submit the form.
