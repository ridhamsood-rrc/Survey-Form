## Debugger Steps

1. The first breakpoint is at the first function, where the javascript
will validate the username input field of the survey form. At this breakpoint,
the javascript will check that the username is filled or not and if not
it will give an error. Whereas, if the username filed is filled then it
will not give any error and moves forward.

2. The second breakpoint is at the second function, where the javascript
will validate that the email address input field is filled and also
validate that the email address is valid i.e, it will check that the
email address has @ sign in that and also checks that the period(.) sign
is also added in the email address. And, if the email address is not filled
or email address is not valid, the user will see an error stopping him/her
to submit the survey form.

3. The third breakpoint is at the last function, where the javascript will
remove all the errors on the screen. In this function, the script will
run through all the errors and if there are errors, it will remove all of
them from the screen and will make the survey form ready to submit. If there
are no errors, the submit button will lead the user to the given link.
